## Hello! Rasheedah here [![alt text][1.1]][1] [![alt text][6.1]][6]

I'm an aspiring PhD researcher with a strong foundation in natural language processing (NLP) and transformer models. Passionate about advancing machine learning, I specialize in topics like contextual embeddings, low-resource model optimization, and multimodal applications. I lead a private research group, actively contribute to open source, and work on projects that explore real-world applications of text generation and efficient model training.
